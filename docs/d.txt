The "IPBlocker" service is one component in a system that can be used
to block systems by managing the adding and removing of null routes.

The core of the IPBlocker service is its backend database.  This
database stores a list of all the IPs that:
 * Are pending being blocked
 * Are currently blocked
 * Are pending being un-blocked
 * Have been unblocked

For each IP the following is also stored:
 * The time it was blocked
 * The time it should be unblocked
 * The time it was unblocked
 * The user or system who requested the block
 * The reason for the block


A second part of IPBlocker is a management program that looks at the
database, and the router config, and then blocks or unblocks an IP
based on the current information.  This management program works as
follows:
  1. Unblocks each IP pending being unblocked
  2. Blocks each IP pending being blocked

This 'unblock' then 'block' order was chosen so that if any failures
occur, it will be more likely that systems will only be unblocked,
rather than systems only being blocked.

The actual method used to block an IP is as follows:
 1. The current null route list is pulled from the router
 2. If the IP is already in this list, a warning is printed
 3. A 'ip route' command is ran to nullroute this IP
 4. The current null route list is pulled again from the router
 5. The new current list is searched for the IP
 6. If it is found, the IP is marked as being blocked
 7. If it is not found, an error is logged that says the IP was unable
 to be blocked

The method used to unblock an IP is the same, but with all the logic
reversed.

The management program runs as a scheduled task at 1 minute intervals.
If the management program ever has trouble blocking or unblocking a
host, it will simply try again 1 minute later.
